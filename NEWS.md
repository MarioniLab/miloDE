# miloDE 0.1.0

New features in 1.0.1:

* Pvalue correction across neighbourhoods is now optional. Default is TRUE, when set to FALSE, correction is not performed and DE testing is much faster.

* We pull other parameters from the graph construction in miloR, thus allowing for different heursitics for KNN-construction
