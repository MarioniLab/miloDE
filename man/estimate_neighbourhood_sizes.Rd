\arguments{
\item{sce}{SCE object}

\item{k_grid}{Vector of positive integers, defines how many neighbours to use for the hood assignment}

\item{order}{In {1,2}, defines which order of neighbours to use}

\item{prop}{Numerical, between 0 and 1, defines fraction of cells from SCE to use for the hoods. Default = 0.1.}

\item{filtering}{In {TRUE,FALSE}, defines whether to filter hoods (reduces computing time greatly). Default = TRUE}

\item{reducedDim_name}{defines the slot in reducedDim(sce) to use as embedding for graph construction}

\item{k_init}{Positive integer, defines how many neighbours to use for identifying anchor cells}

\item{d}{Positive integer, defines how many dimensions from reducedDim(sce) to use}

\item{quantile_vec}{Vector of distribution quantiles to be estimated. Default = seq(0,1,0.25)}
}

}
\description{
For a grid of k (order fixed), return hood size distribution; that will help a user to select appropriate k
