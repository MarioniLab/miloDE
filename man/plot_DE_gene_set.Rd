\usage{
plot_DE_gene_set(
  x,
  de_stat,
  genes,
  logFC_correction = TRUE,
  correction_by = "pval_corrected_across_nhoods",
  alpha = 0.1,
  layout = "UMAP",
  subset_nhoods = NULL,

)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A \code{\linkS4class{Milo}} object.}

\item{de_stat}{miloDE stat (output of \code{\link{de_test_neighbourhoods}}).}

\item{genes}{Character vector, each element corresponds to a gene from the set.}

\item{logFC_correction}{Boolean specifying whether to perform logFC correction. If TRUE (default), logFC will be set to 0 if corrected p-value (defined by \code{correction_by}) < alpha.}

\item{correction_by}{Character specifying specifying which column to use to decide on significance for logFC.
Should be an in \code{assays(de_stat)} or in \code{colnames(de_stat)} (depends on \code{de_stat} format). Default \code{correction_by = "pval_corrected_across_nhoods"}.
Expected to be in \code{c("pval", "pval_corrected_across_nhoods", "pval_corrected_across_genes")}.}

\item{alpha}{A scalar (between 0 and 1) specifying the significance level used. Default \code{alpha = 0.1}.}

\item{layout}{A character indicating the name of the \code{reducedDim} slot in the \code{\linkS4class{Milo}} object to use for layout. Default \code{layout = "UMAP"}.}

\item{subset_nhoods}{A vector (or NULL) specifying which neighbourhoods will be plotted. Default = NULL meaning that all neighbourhoods will be plotted.
Default \code{subset_nhoods = NULL} meaning that no subsetting is performed.
If not NULL, should be a numeric vector, which values lie within \code{c(1:ncol(nhoods(x)))}.}

\item{...}{Arguments to pass to \code{plot_milo_by_single_metric} (e.g. size_range, node_stroke etc)).}
}
\value{
\sQuote{Neighbourhood} plot (\code{ggplot} object), in which each neighbourhood is coloured by average logFC across the selected genes; neighbourhood size corresponds to the fraction of genes that are DE in this neighbourhood (based on pval_corrected_across_nhoods).
}
\description{
Returns \sQuote{neighbourhood} plot, in which colour of nodes correspond to average logFC across selected genes; size corresponds to how many genes show significant DE in the neighbourhood (using \code{correction_by})
